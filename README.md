# ML_Project-Concert_Experience
There were four different classes, the dataset consisted of 17 features and was split into a training set with 170000 observations and a test set with 30000 observations. 
All the preprocessing  (e.g. replacing missing values, removing outliers, normalizing the data) and feature engineering (including exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and encoding) is done. 
I tested various models using cross-validation, and finally optimized the best performing model through hyperparameter tuning (I only kept the best hyperparameters and removed the tuning from the notebook to reduce the runtime).
